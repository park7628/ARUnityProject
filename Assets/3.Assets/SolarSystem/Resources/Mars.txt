Mars is the fourth planet from the
 Sun and the second smallest planet
 in the Solar System, after Mercury. 
Named after the Roman god of war, 
it is often referred to as the "Red Planet" 
because the iron oxide prevalent on 
its surface gives it a reddish appearance 
Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin 
atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent
both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, 
deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. 


The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar 
 to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. 
 Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest 
 known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the  
largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern 
 hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. 
 Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. 
 These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
