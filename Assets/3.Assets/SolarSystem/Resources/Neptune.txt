Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. 
It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass.
Among the giant planets in the Solar System, Neptune is the most dense. 
Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus,
which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. 
Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.50×109 km).
Named after the Roman god of the sea, its astronomical symbol is ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found
thus far by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes
in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational
perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846
by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, 
was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically
until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging
to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989.
